## High-Level Architecture Overview

![General Solution](/architecture-solution/diagrams/Kata2025-Test2-general.png)

The AI Grading Service is designed to automate the grading process for educational institutions. It leverages machine learning algorithms to evaluate and score student submissions efficiently and accurately. The service is composed of several key components:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Collects and preprocesses student submissions from various sources.
2. **Model Training**: Utilizes historical grading data to train machine learning models.
3. **Grading Engine**: Applies trained models to new submissions to generate grades.
4. **Feedback Generation**: Provides detailed feedback to students based on their performance.
5. **Integration Layer**: Ensures seamless integration with existing educational platforms and databases.

For a detailed description, refer to the [Architecture Decision Record](/architecture-solution/adr/01_adr_test2_general_solution.md).

This architecture ensures scalability, reliability, and accuracy in the grading process, significantly reducing the manual effort required by educators.
