## On-Prem: High Risk, Low Flexibility

An On-Premises solution seemed cost-effective at first glance. However, detailed calculations exposed substantial financial and operational burdens, including:
- **High CapEx and OpEx**: Infrastructure investments are substantial, with ongoing maintenance costs.
- **Maintenance Risks**: Hardware failures, such as a GPU malfunction, require immediate, costly replacements or system migrations.
- **Resource Constraints**: Requires in-house expertise and resources for maintenance and scaling.

### Cost Breakdown:
- **2x A100 80** GPUs → $16.71 per hour
- **4x 5090 128** GPUs → $16.38 per hour

**Additional Risks:**
- No built-in geo-redundancy or disaster recovery, unlike cloud solutions.
- Increased dependency on internal teams for support and upgrades.

### Conclusion:
On-Prem is unsuitable due to high upfront costs, maintenance risks, and scalability challenges. It may only be viable if reusable infrastructure and in-house expertise are readily available.

## SaaS: Convenience with Limitations

SaaS solutions, such as GPT-4, provide ease of use and rapid deployment but introduce significant cost and privacy concerns.

### Cost Analysis:
For processing **20,000 tokens** per submission:
- **Input**: 1000 tokens × $0.03 × 20,000 = $480 per submission
- **Output**: 1000 tokens × 4 × $0.06 = $240 per submission
- **Total for 2 submissions**: $480 + $240 = $720

### Key Drawbacks:
- **Data Privacy Risks**: Potential exposure to logging and retention policies by the SaaS provider.
- **Limited Customization**: Restricted fine-tuning capabilities compared to self-hosted solutions.
- **Vendor Lock-In**: Migration to another provider may require significant code changes.

### Conclusion:
SaaS is not suitable for our needs due to high operational costs, data privacy concerns, and limited customization.

## IaaS: The Optimal Hybrid Solution (Our Choice)

**IaaS** emerged as the most flexible and cost-effective option, balancing scalability, control, and risk management. It allows us to fine-tune our LLM solution while leveraging cloud infrastructure's redundancy and scalability.

### Cost Comparison:
1. [AWS](https://calculator.aws/#/estimate?id=67ddc5a282d4d84c832c1ddb77cff988fbb5e7e3)
2. [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator?dl=CjhDaVE0TVRVNE16RmhOQzAwWlRZM0xUUTJaV010T1dNMFppMHlPV00wTmpVNVpqWmxZemNRQVE9PRAQGiQ1QkZFRTg3Ni0xNTg1LTQzNEUtQTQ4RS0xN0I1RjU0NTFFMzY)
3. [Microsoft Azure 8x NVIDIA A100](https://azure.com/e/a31f037aebdb4c55877a5c7813f4cf70)
4. [Microsoft Azure 1x NVIDIA A100](https://azure.com/e/6d46ec252b5747809f8d0776ad8daf1b)

### Advantages:
- **Scalability**: Easily adjust resources based on workload demands.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Pay-as-you-go model reduces upfront costs.
- **Customizability**: Full control over infrastructure configuration and model tuning.

### Tradeoff Analysis:
![EnvironmentTradeoff.png](../img/EnvironmentTradeoff.png)

Based on the above comparison, we face a tradeoff between using **Microsoft's cheaper A100 HMs** versus **8x A100** for processing **2000 candidates load**:
- **A100 HMs**: Requires **92 hours** at a cost of **$340**
- **8x A100**: Completes in **13 hours** at a cost of **$358**

Although the A100 HMs are slightly cheaper, the significant difference in processing time makes the **8x A100** a more logical choice. It offers a better balance of cost and time efficiency, ensuring faster delivery without a substantial cost increase.


### Conclusion:
IaaS offers the right balance of flexibility, scalability, and cost-efficiency. It minimizes operational risks compared to On-Prem solutions while avoiding the high costs and vendor lock-in issues associated with SaaS.

Based on what you can see on screenshot we have tradeoff to use microsoft cheaper A100 HMs but process 92 hours on 2000 candidates load for 340 \$ vs 13 hours for 8x A100 for 358 \$. It seems logical to keep top tier HM based on difference in time and cost profit.

## Final Recommendation:
Based on our detailed analysis, **IaaS** is the optimal choice for our LLM solution. It provides:
- **Scalable infrastructure** to handle variable workloads
- **Operational flexibility** without significant upfront investments
- **Reduced risk** through cloud-based redundancy and disaster recovery options

This strategic choice aligns with our cost optimization goals while ensuring scalability and maintainability for our solution.
