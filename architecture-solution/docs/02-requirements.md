# Requirements

## 1. Formalized Requirements
Formalized requirements are explicitly defined, structured, and measurable constraints that the system must adhere to.

### **1.1 Certification Process Requirements**
- The system must support two certification tests:
  - **Aptitude Test:** Multiple-choice and short-answer questions.
  - **Architecture Submission:** A case study-based test.
- Multiple-choice questions must be **auto-graded**, while short-answer questions must be **manually reviewed** by expert software architects.
- A passing score of **80% or higher** is required for both tests.
- Candidates have **30 days** to start the architecture submission after passing the aptitude test.
- The architecture submission must be **uploaded within 2 weeks** after the case study is assigned.
- Candidates who fail should receive **detailed feedback** from expert software architects.
- Companies must be able to **verify certification status** via a public verification portal.

### **1.2 Administrative Process Requirements**
- Expert software architects are responsible for **grading short-answer questions and architecture submissions**.
- The system must ensure a **1-week grading turnaround** for both tests.
- Designated experts must be able to **modify certification tests** based on industry trends and performance reports.
- The system must support **periodic updates** to case studies to prevent leaks.
- Administrators must be able to **manage expert profiles and access control**.

### **1.3 Scalability & Performance Requirements**
- The system must handle a **5–10× increase** in certification requests due to global expansion.
- AI-powered automation should **reduce manual workload** while maintaining grading accuracy.
- The system must **guarantee a 1-week turnaround** for grading.
- The architecture should support **horizontal scaling** to accommodate demand surges.

### **1.4 Security & Compliance Requirements**
- The certification process must include **fraud prevention measures** (e.g., test timing, AI-based plagiarism detection).
- Secure **role-based access control (RBAC)** for experts and administrators.
- Certification records must be **immutable, verifiable, and tamper-proof**.

## 2. Non-Formalized Requirements
Non-formalized requirements are implicit, evolving, or subjective aspects that contribute to system usability and strategic decisions.

### **2.1 Usability & User Experience**
- The certification process should provide an **intuitive and seamless user experience** for candidates, experts, and administrators.
- The grading interface for expert software architects must be **efficient and user-friendly**.
- Candidates should receive **clear and constructive feedback** on their submissions.

### **2.2 AI Integration Expectations**
- AI should be **an assistive tool, not a replacement** for expert software architects.
- AI models should provide **grading recommendations** but not make final grading decisions autonomously.
- AI integration should ensure **fair and unbiased assessments**.

### **2.3 Cost Considerations**
- AI-powered automation should be **cost-effective** without significant cost overruns.
- Cloud-based infrastructure should be **optimized for resource efficiency**.
- The system should leverage **auto-scaling** to manage infrastructure costs dynamically.

### **2.4 Market & Competitive Positioning**
- The certification system must **maintain industry leadership** and credibility.
- Accuracy in grading is **critical for the company's reputation**—errors could impact candidates' careers.
- The system should **adapt to new industry trends** in software architecture.
