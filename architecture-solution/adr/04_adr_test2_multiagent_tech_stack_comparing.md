# Architecture Decision Record (ADR): Multi-Agent Framework Selection

## **Title**
Selection of a Multi-Agent Framework for AI Task Orchestration


## **Context**
The system requires a framework to coordinate AI agents for tasks such as grading, workflow management, and collaborative problem-solving. Key requirements include:
- Support for **dynamic agent collaboration** (e.g., functional vs. non-functional requirement agents).
- Integration with **LLMs** and observability tools (e.g., ollama local inference).
- Scalability to handle high-volume tasks (e.g., document analyze).
- Flexibility to adapt to evolving use cases (e.g., manual grating automation).

## **Decision**
Evaluate three frameworks: **n8n**, **crewAI**, and **LangChain,LangSmith,LangGraph**. Use a scoring model to determine the best fit.

## **Recommendation**
**LangChain,LangSmith,LangGraph** is the strongest candidate due to its:
1. **Native multi-agent coordination** (LangGraph).
2. **End-to-end observability** (LangSmith) for compliance with Laugedgan-based monitoring.
3. **Scalability** for high-throughput tasks like grading and workflow management.

## **Consequences**
- **Pros**:
    - Future-proofing for advanced AI agent use cases.
    - Seamless integration with existing LLM and observability components.
- **Cons**:
    - Increased development time to master the ecosystem.
    - Potential costs for LangSmith at scale.

## **Alternatives**
- **crewAI**: Suitable for simpler agent systems with limited monitoring needs.
- **n8n**: Ideal for workflow automation but not AI-centric multi-agent tasks.
