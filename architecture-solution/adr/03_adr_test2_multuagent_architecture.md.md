# ADR-004: Multi-Agent Architecture

## **Title**
Multi-Agent Architecture Overview

## **Context**
A multi-agent architecture is particularly ideal for initial requirements due to its ability to address **complexity**, **specialization**, and **scalability** while aligning with the system’s modular design.

---

## 1. **Specialization of Roles**
### **Key Advantage**:
- **Functional Segregation**:
    - Agents like the *Functional Requirement Agent* and *Non-Functional Requirement Agent* focus on distinct aspects of the system (e.g., business logic vs. performance/security). This specialization ensures high expertise in each domain.
    - Example: The *Diagram Processing Agent* handles visual tasks independently, avoiding interference with logic-focused agents.

### **Why It Fits**:
- The architecture involves diverse tasks (validation, scoring, diagram generation), which are best handled by dedicated agents rather than a monolithic system.

---

## 2. **Scalability and Flexibility**
### **Key Advantage**:
- **Modular Expansion**:
    - New agents (e.g., for emerging requirements like compliance checks) can be added without disrupting existing workflows.
    - Example: Adding an *AI Ethics Agent* to audit LLM outputs would require minimal changes to other components.

### **Why It Fits**:
- The system’s reliance on evolving technologies (dedicated LLMs, LangChain) demands a flexible architecture that adapts to future needs.

---

## 3. **Collaborative Problem-Solving**
### **Key Advantage**:
- **Cross-Agent Coordination**:
    - Agents collaborate to resolve complex tasks. For instance:
        - The *Functional Requirement Agent* defines business logic.
        - The *Non-Functional Requirement Agent* ensures scalability.
        - The *LLM* provides contextual insights.
    - This synergy ensures holistic solutions.

### **Why It Fits**:
- Tasks like "last visual analysis" require input from multiple agents (LLM for analysis, Diagram Agent for visualization), making collaboration essential.

---

## 4. **Fault Tolerance and Resilience**
### **Key Advantage**:
- **Decentralized Risk**:
    - If one agent fails (e.g., *Non-Functional Requirement Agent*), others can continue operating and score submission.
    - Example: Manual Grating Service(experts) can handle exceptions flagged by failed automated agents.

### **Why It Fits**:
- The system not dependency on runtime external tools/services/systems.
---

## 5. **Efficiency in Parallel Processing**
### **Key Advantage**:
- **Concurrent Task Execution**:
    - Agents operate autonomously, enabling parallel processing of tasks (e.g., prompt validation, scoring, and workflow management can occur simultaneously).

### **Why It Fits**:
- High-volume tasks benefit from distributed processing to avoid bottlenecks.

---

## 6. **Alignment with Observability Goals**
### **Key Advantage**:
- **Granular Monitoring**:
    - The *Observability Module* can track individual agent performance (e.g., latency of the LLM, error rates in Diagram Processing).

### **Why It Fits**:
- The architecture’s emphasis on LangSmith-based observability aligns with the need to monitor decentralized components.

---

## **Challenges of Multi-Agent Architecture (and Mitigations)**
While beneficial, the approach introduces challenges:
1. **Agent Coordination Complexity**:
    - **Risk**: Overlapping responsibilities or communication delays.
    - **Mitigation**: Use a centralized *Router* to manage task distribution and agent interactions.

2. **Redundancy**:
    - **Risk**: Repeated prompts/analyses waste resources.
    - **Mitigation**: Implement dynamic templates or caching mechanisms.

---

## **Conclusion**
The multi-agent architecture is ideal for this solution because it:
- **Specializes** in handling diverse tasks (functional, non-functional, visual).
- **Scales** seamlessly with modular updates.
- **Collaborates** to solve complex, interdependent problems.
- **Resists failures** through decentralized design.
