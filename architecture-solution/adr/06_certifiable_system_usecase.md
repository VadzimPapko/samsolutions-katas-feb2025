# Architecture Decision Record (ADR): Use cases for Certificable, Inc Platform

## **Context**
The platform aims to streamline candidate testing, result assessment, and administrative workflows. Key actors include **Candidates**, **Administrators**, **HR**, **Experts** and  **AI Engenieer**.

Core use cases:
1. Candidates: take aptitude test; solve Case Study; submit solution; view Results; complaint process
2. Administrators: manage Candidate/Expert profiles; handle Complaints.
3. HRs: get certification results
4. Experts: manual grading
5. AI-Engineers: configure Workflows; add/edit Tests; fine-Tune Models.


## **Use Cases**

### **1. Candidate Interactions**
- **Aptitude test**
    - The candidate initiates and completes aptitude test.
- **Case Study**
    - The candidate initiates and completes case study.
- **Assess Submission**
    - The candidate submits their test responses for evaluation.
- **Results and Complaints**
